Welcome to my homepage.

I’m a theoretical and computational astrophysicist from Lebanon, currently based in Spain. My research delves into the extraordinary physics of neutron stars—exotic cosmic laboratories where immense magnetic fields, ultra-dense nuclear matter, and quantum anomalies converge.

After earning my Bachelor’s degree in Physics in Lebanon, I pursued advanced studies across Italy, France, and Spain through the Erasmus Mundus Joint Master in Nuclear Physics, supported by a competitive European scholarship. I completed my PhD at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, developing MATINS, a pioneering 3D magneto-thermal simulation code tailored for isolated neutron stars. Currently, as a Juan de la Cierva Fellow—an appointment awarded through a national research fellowship—I investigate how magnetic helicity and chiral anomalies influence their long-term evolution.

I have a passion for coding and computational problem-solving. I led the magnetic field modeling component of MATINS, enhancing its capability to simulate detailed magneto-thermal processes within neutron star crusts.

My expertise extends beyond astrophysics into nuclear theory. Collaborating with colleagues, I have developed a finite-temperature equation of state crucial for understanding the late stages of proto-neutron stars and the aftermath of binary neutron star mergers.

Here you’ll find insights into my research, teaching experiences, publications, and selected projects—each a testament to the curiosity and rigor that shape my scientific journey.
