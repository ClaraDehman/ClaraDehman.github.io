**<span class="blue">Welcome to my homepage!</span>**

I’m a theoretical and computational astrophysicist from <span class="blue">Lebanon</span>, currently based in <span class="blue">Spain</span>. My research delves into the extraordinary physics of <span class="blue">neutron stars</span>—<em>exotic cosmic laboratories</em> where immense <span class="blue">magnetic fields</span>, <span class="blue">ultra-dense nuclear matter</span>, and <span class="blue">quantum anomalies</span> converge.

After earning my <strong class="blue">Bachelor’s degree in Physics</strong> in Lebanon, I pursued advanced studies across Italy, France, and Spain through the <em>Erasmus Mundus Joint Master in Nuclear Physics</em>, supported by a competitive <span class="blue">European scholarship</span>. I completed my <strong class="blue">PhD</strong> at the <em>Autonomous University of Barcelona</em>, developing <strong class="blue">MATINS</strong>, a pioneering <span class="blue">3D magneto-thermal simulation code</span> tailored for <em>isolated neutron stars</em>.

This work was driven by my deep passion for <span class="blue">coding</span> and <span class="blue">computational problem-solving</span>, especially the challenge of <span class="blue">designing</span> and <span class="blue">debugging</span> complex numerical physics models.

Currently, as a <strong class="blue">Juan de la Cierva Fellow</strong>—awarded through a competitive national research program—I investigate how <span class="blue">magnetic helicity</span> and <span class="blue">chiral anomalies</span> influence neutron star magnetic field evolution.


<!--I led the development of MATINS, focusing on the *magnetic field modeling component* and the implementation of its distinctive *cubed-sphere grid*, enabling detailed magneto-thermal simulations of neutron star crusts over million-year timescales. -->

<!-- Furthermore, my recent research explores the pivotal role of **magnetic helicity** in neutron star magnetic field evolution—a concept not widely explored in *neutron star physics* literature. Specifically, I study the *inverse cascade phenomenon* triggered by an initial helical field in magnetars. In a groundbreaking approach, I applied the concept of the **chiral magnetic effect** to neutron star magnetic field modeling, revealing how magnetic helicity alone can generate chiral asymmetry. This mechanism reshapes initially turbulent, small-scale magnetic structures into coherent, large-scale fields (\~10¹⁴ G), typical of observed magnetars. Thus, this innovative model addresses a longstanding open question in astrophysical research. -->

<!-- Beyond astrophysics, my expertise extends into **nuclear theory**. Collaborating with colleagues, I developed a **finite-temperature equation of state** critical for studying late-stage proto-neutron stars and the aftermath of binary neutron star mergers. -->
