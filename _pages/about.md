**Welcome to my homepage!**

I’m a theoretical and computational astrophysicist from **Lebanon**, currently based in **Spain**. My research delves into the extraordinary physics of **neutron stars**—*exotic cosmic laboratories* where immense **magnetic fields**, **ultra-dense nuclear matter**, and **quantum anomalies** converge.

After earning my **Bachelor’s degree in Physics** in Lebanon, I pursued advanced studies across Italy, France, and Spain through the *Erasmus Mundus Joint Master in Nuclear Physics,* supported by a competitive **European scholarship**. I completed my **PhD** at the *Autonomous University of Barcelona*, developing **MATINS**, a pioneering **3D magneto-thermal simulation code** tailored specifically for *isolated neutron stars*. This work was driven by my deep passion for coding and computational problem-solving, particularly the challenge of designing and debugging complex numerical physics problems. Currently, as a **Juan de la Cierva Fellow**—awarded through a competitive national research fellowship—I investigate how **magnetic helicity** and **chiral anomalies** influence neutron star evolution.


<!--I led the development of MATINS, focusing on the *magnetic field modeling component* and the implementation of its distinctive *cubed-sphere grid*, enabling detailed magneto-thermal simulations of neutron star crusts over million-year timescales. -->

<!-- Furthermore, my recent research explores the pivotal role of **magnetic helicity** in neutron star magnetic field evolution—a concept not widely explored in *neutron star physics* literature. Specifically, I study the *inverse cascade phenomenon* triggered by an initial helical field in magnetars. In a groundbreaking approach, I applied the concept of the **chiral magnetic effect** to neutron star magnetic field modeling, revealing how magnetic helicity alone can generate chiral asymmetry. This mechanism reshapes initially turbulent, small-scale magnetic structures into coherent, large-scale fields (\~10¹⁴ G), typical of observed magnetars. Thus, this innovative model addresses a longstanding open question in astrophysical research. -->

<!-- Beyond astrophysics, my expertise extends into **nuclear theory**. Collaborating with colleagues, I developed a **finite-temperature equation of state** critical for studying late-stage proto-neutron stars and the aftermath of binary neutron star mergers. -->
