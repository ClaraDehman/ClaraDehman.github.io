**Welcome to my homepage!**

I’m a theoretical and computational astrophysicist from **Lebanon**, currently based in **Spain**. My research delves into the extraordinary physics of **neutron stars**—*exotic cosmic laboratories* where immense **magnetic fields**, **ultra-dense nuclear matter**, and **quantum anomalies** converge.

After earning my **Bachelor’s degree in Physics** in Lebanon, I pursued advanced studies across Italy, France, and Spain through the *Erasmus Mundus Joint Master in Nuclear Physics,* supported by a competitive **European scholarship**. I completed my **PhD** at the *Autonomous University of Barcelona*, developing **MATINS**, a pioneering **3D magneto-thermal simulation code** tailored specifically for *isolated neutron stars*. Currently, as a **Juan de la Cierva Fellow**—awarded through a competitive national research fellowship—I investigate how **magnetic helicity** and **chiral anomalies** influence neutron star evolution.

I have a deep passion for coding and computational problem-solving, particularly enjoying the challenges of developing and debugging complex numerical physics problems. I led the development of MATINS, focusing on the *magnetic field modeling component* and the implementation of its distinctive *cubed-sphere grid*, enabling detailed magneto-thermal simulations of neutron star crusts over million-year timescales.

Beyond astrophysics, my expertise extends into **nuclear theory**. Collaborating with colleagues, I developed a **finite-temperature equation of state** critical for studying late-stage proto-neutron stars and the aftermath of binary neutron star mergers.

Here you’ll find insights into my **research**, **teaching experiences**, **publications**, and **selected projects**—each reflecting the curiosity and rigor that shape my scientific journey.
